        <h3>Welcome!</h3>
        <p>I am a web developer, a designer, a musician, and a producer. I love to build things, whether its single page websites to full CRUD applications, I want in on it! With a degree in Digital Media, I studied web developement, graphic design, audio engineering, and even film editing. I live in Denver, Colorado with a passion for the outdoors. If I don't have my head buried in a project, you can find me in the mountains looking for adventures. Have a look around at some of the things I've created, and thanks for stopping by!</p>
